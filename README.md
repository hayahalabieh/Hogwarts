# Hogwarts
Learning Materials I created for Python / Data Manipulation

In an effort to making learning python and further data analysis in python more accessible for my colleagues at work, I created a series of jupyter notebooks (Hogwarts themed). 

- Slytherin: Intro to Python
- Gryffindor: Objects and Classes (in progress)
- Ravenclaw: Interacting with SQL Databases
- Hufflepuff: Data Science Methods
